    <p>Personally, the best programming languages to use when developing on Linux, has to be C, C++, Java, Python, Assembly, and Bash. I would recommend C</p>
    <p>and C++ since they are low-level languages. When talking about programming languages and levels, low level has more power then high level. Low level</p>
    <p>programming languages have the ability to talk directly to the hardware and processor of the device. That is something windows users don't have much</p>
    <p>freedom when developing software that depends heavily on the speed when compiling the code. Mostly with Window's lack of security when it comes to</p>
    <p>software being shared for everyone to use. MacOS doesn't even have this problem, since both MacOS and Linux are Unix based.</p>

    <p>Sorry if website is garbage, I don't know how to use CSS and barely HTML.</p>
